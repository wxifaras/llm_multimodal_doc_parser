# Processes local PDF or PowerPoint files by extracting any embedded text, rendering each page or slide to an image, and sending combined text + base64 images to an Azure OpenAI (multimodal) deployment to obtain structured markdown (page/slide text plus image insights) which it consolidates into output files; it also includes helper functions for plain chat inference, structured (Pydantic) responses, tool/function calling, streaming outputs, image analysis examples, and embedding generation, making it a lightweight multimodal document-to-markdown and insight extraction pipeline driven by Azure OpenAI
